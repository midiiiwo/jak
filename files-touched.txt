==================

jak/files-touched.txt - Created tracking file
jak/admin-fixes.md - Created admin side fixes tracking document
jak/customer-fixes.md - Created customer side fixes tracking document

ANALYSIS PHASE:
- Analyzed package.json, Firebase config, API routes
- Identified database service is using wrong Firebase SDK imports
- Found admin products trying to fetch from /api/admin/products but failing
- Found customer side using static hardcoded data

ADMIN FIXES PHASE:
jak/lib/services/database-service.ts - Fixed Firebase SDK mismatch, replaced client SDK imports with admin SDK usage

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
- Stock management API still using mock data instead of Firebase
- Need to check customer-side components for real data fetching
- Product form and individual product API routes look good

jak/components/home/featured-products-section.tsx - FIXED: Replaced static ProductsDetails array with API fetching from /api/products for featured products section
jak/components/shop/index.tsx - FIXED: Replaced static category filtering with dynamic API-based category fetching and proper filter passing to Products component
jak/app/api/admin/stock/route.ts - FIXED: Parameter mismatch - added support for both itemId and productId parameters to match admin component calls
